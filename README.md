# GIT FIND PEOPLE
### Find the best talent per your requirements with languages and skillset

The whole idea of the project is to find best technical talent with required skill set.
Say you want to find some engineers with JavaScript as the main language and Java + Scala as secondary languages, 
you can find those engineers with this application and the results are based on their github repositories.

This just has the backend services up and running, need little more brushing on the how the data is retrieved and filtered.

* Filtering Criteria:
 * Number of Stars
 * Repo main Language And many more.

* Todo:
 * Front End
